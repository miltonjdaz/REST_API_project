# REST_API_project
Exporting GitHub commits using REST APIs and displaying which repository has the most commits 

Originally, this project had 2 Python scripts and 3 CSV files. As I worked on the project, I realized that I could have a better result with just one Python Script. The 2nd draft of the project is broken down into 3 parts: a function to get the total count of commits in each repository, creating a list with appending the number of commits, and making the bar graph. I am happy that I decided to modify my project as time went on. Less than 40 lines of code brings a better result than 2 Python scripts and 3 CSV files. It is important to be flexible with projects otherwise you will not find the best solution.
